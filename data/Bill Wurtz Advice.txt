When I begin a project I feel super overly motivated and work super hard but eventually I always burn out, even if I love the project. 

I've been working on my current one on and off for a year and I'm forcing myself to finish because I've never finished anything. I would love 
to see it to completion and I love the project but I can't get myself to work on it. This might be a shot in the dark but any advice?
     my standard advice for this is to try doing projects of a smaller size. if you are still having the same symptoms, just try even smaller 
projects. keep reducing the project size until completion is easily and handily within sight. i think you will find a lot of newfound excitement
 in actually completing something for once! and you will actually learn a lot very quickly. it's like when you first walk into a new house,
you walk through the entire house once. even if you don't do anything in each room yet, just walk through each room. Now you know how big the 
house is! and you generally know how it goes! very powerful information, will pave the way for bigger ideas in subsequent episodes
