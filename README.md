# Text-Editor
A simple text editor. Made for CSE 218 at SCCC. Made before I started using SceneBuilder.

# Features
- Spellcheck using a dictionary hash.
- Calculates Flesch Score using syllable, word, and sentence counts.
- Text generator to create text of specified length using a given text file for training.
- Can truncate the text file into 20 subfiles, each one containing 5% to 100% of the total number of words.
- Can create a graph comparing the computation times of single-loop vs. 3-loop calculation of the Flesch Score of the subfiles.
- Plots these results on a graph.
